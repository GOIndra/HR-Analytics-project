# HR-Analytics-project
Atliq technology, software and data solution company have shared employee presence data of three months and they want to see the pattern of presence    
or absence of employees, based on which they are able to take insights for handling their manpower in better way. 

Analytical Demand of HR team of Atliq company:


1) working preference of people( work from home or work from office)

2) find sick leave pattern how they are taking sick leaves to draw connection for disease pattern per season for
   taking precautions,sanitization etc

3) on which weekdays people are more taking WFH or sick leave or presence is high

4) WFH Pattern:         By knowing these we can arrange accordingly less space in the office. that will reduce our
                        total cost(electricity, water etc), and people will be fine to work from home
                        [ win win situation]

5) SL Pattern:          By knowing this we can understand in which month peolpe are
                        getting sick, so we can take precautions beforehand for them like sanitization and extra 
                        care for hygiene. 
             
                        we can get to know on which day of week mostly people are taking their leave then on that day 
                        impoertant meetings should not be arranged due to low present percentage probability.

6) Present percentage:  On which month the present percentage is the most then that month would be the most productive month of 
                        the year and we can increase our workload.
                       
                        the same thing applies for the week also  
                      
                        in the festive seasons like diwali in india the present percentage gets lower so we can easily conclude
                        certain delay in our work 
       
                        by knowing on which particular day we see drop in present percentage we can postpone our important meetings later 
                        on
                    
                        The employee whose present percentage is good like 100% , should get acknowledged and rewarded.
